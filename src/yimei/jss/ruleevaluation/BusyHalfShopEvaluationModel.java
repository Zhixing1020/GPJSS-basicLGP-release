/**
 * The busy HalfShop surrogate evaluation model. It is extended from
 * the HalfShop surrogate evaluation model by simply setting a full
 * utilization level - util = 1.
 *
 * The HalfShop surrogate evaluation model proposed in
 * Nguyen, S., Zhang, M., Tan, K.C., 2016.
 * Surrogate-Assisted Genetic Programming With Simplified Models
 * for Automated Design of Dispatching Rules.
 * IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics 1â€“15.
 *
 * If use surrogate, then use the HalfShop surrogate model to evaluate.
 * Otherwise, use the original scheduling set.
